## Item types

| Type | Schema `questionType` | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| Multiple choice | `single` (default) | 4 choices, scenario/case-study stems |
| Multiple select | `multi` | `correctIndexes` + `correctIndex` = first |
| Drag/drop matching | `match` | `matchLeftItems`, `matchRightItems`, `correctMatches` |
| Scenario-based | `single` or `multi` | Real-world platform owner context |

Target mix: ~60% single, ~20% multi, ~20% match.

## Exam domain quotas (100 questions)

| # | Domain | % | Bank | Orders |
|---|--------|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Strategy | 21.4% | 21 | 0–20 |
| 2 | People | 15.7% | 16 | 21–36 |
| 3 | Process | 15.7% | 16 | 37–52 |

## Question style

- Associate-level voice for platform owners with 3–5 years ServiceNow experience.
- Tactical responsibilities under senior guidance: roadmaps, OCM, SDLC, upgrades, CMDB, licensing, support portal.
- Banned: template wrappers (`Typically,`, `From a governance perspective,`, etc.).
- Multi-select prompts must state "Choose two" or similar.
- Match items use no partial credit; every left item must have one correct right target.
